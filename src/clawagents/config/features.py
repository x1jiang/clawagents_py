"""Feature flags for ClawAgents.

Inspired by Claude Code's build-time feature() system — but runtime-based
so features can be toggled via environment variables without rebuilding.

Usage:
    from clawagents.config.features import is_enabled

    if is_enabled("micro_compact"):
        messages = _micro_compact_tool_results(messages)
