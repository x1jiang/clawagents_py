"""enter_plan_mode / exit_plan_mode built-in tools.

Plan mode is a soft-readonly stance the model can opt into to design an
approach before mutating state. While in plan mode, the registry refuses
write-class tools (see :mod:`clawagents.permissions.mode`).

``exit_plan_mode`` optionally waits for a host approval callback before
unlocking writes (Grok Build parity). With no callback registered it
auto-approves for backward compatibility.
